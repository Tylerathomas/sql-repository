# Atmosfy Analysis By Tyler Thomas

## Project Objective

Determining what factors in user reviews and comments that can give competing apps an advantage or disadvantage and leveraging that for Atmosfy.

I am searching through user reviews to parse through what users really like or really dislike about certain apps to see what advantages and disadvantages they have.

## Job Description

The job posting is for a Data Analyst position at Atmosfy, Inc, a platform for live video of dining and nightlife that supports local businesses globally by sharing unique experiences through video. The Data Analyst will be responsible for conducting analysis to support the Product Team by developing insights for the product roadmap, leading research and KPI strategies, and generating tangible insights in support of the execution of the roadmap.

The ideal candidate should have a bachelor's degree in MIS, Business, Finance, or a related field, 1+ years of working experience in data or analytics, proficiency in SQL and Excel, and the ability to work cross-functionally in a fast-paced environment.

By looking at the reviews of other companies, I am showing Atmosfy what they need to leverage to gain a competitive advantage.

## Future Improvements

Picking better data sources, these sources had many inconsistencies. Spending more time to clean would be nice. Not rushing this in the last week of my school year would also be nice.
